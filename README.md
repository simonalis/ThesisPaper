The paper used [1] dataset and export vectors from the FIFTY classification model as a feature extraction layer.
The FiFty dataset is divided into a smaller datasets. We used dataset number 1 to validate all possible file types.

The attached jupyter will create the feautre and create CBR classifier.

The entire dataset is large but can be easily downloaded from the original sources and convert it.
